        <h1>The Nature of Time</h1>
         <section>
                <h2  class="majorpoints">What is Time?</h2>
                <p>As often as our lives revolve around time and the amount of successes that have been made in physics at understanding time the nature of time is still very much a mystery. [<cite>see the box below on <u>Spacetime and Einstein</u></cite>]</p>

                <p>What philosophers of time have focused on is to understand what a fundamental theory of time <em>would look like</em>. Around a century ago a philosopher named J.M.E. McTaggart introduced a few theories that he believed categorized time in a manner that philosophers of time have found very useful when discussing the nature of time. One theory he called "A-Theory" and the other major theory of time he labelled "B-theory." Let's review both theories in detail.</p>

                <h3><b>A-theory of Time</b></h3>
                A-theory is based on our general or everyday conception of time. We consider the past as having already occurred, the present as now occurring, and the future not having <i>yet</i> occurred. Consider the following example:
                    Peter is playing baseball in the park with hits friends and exactly at <time>12:00 pm</time> a ball that he hit comes in contact with a window and shatters the glass. The time in this case is what philosophers call as <strong>tensed.</strong> Tensed means that there is something real about time that cannot be put in any other terms than the past has already happened, while the present is the ball breaking the window, and the future has yet to happen (e.g., when Peter and his friends respond to the broken window by running like heck to avoid taking responsibility for the damage caused by the ball). 

                <h3><b>B-theory of Time</b></h3>
                B-theory offers a completely different perspective of the nature of time. Consider the same scenario with Peter but from a B-theory perspective. Think of <time>12:00 pm</time> not as a tensed event, but rather as a <q>tenseless</q> event. A tenseless event can refer to a past, present, and future event, but it does so with the perspective of a <q>God's eye</q> perspective. In this case, we need to look at time like a spatial dimension. There's obviously a <q>before than</q> the window breaking at <time>12:00 pm</time> but spatially speaking this is similar to an event that happened a few miles before you reached your destination. How you consider what is before and after is just a matter of what mile marker you wish to point to. <time>12:00 pm</time> is mile marker 12, but there are of course mile markers 9, 10, 11 leading up to that mile marker. Similarly, there are mile markers 13, 14, 15, etc. that are spatially beyond your destination. If we correlate this way of thinking of past, present, and future, then instead of looking at the flow of time as real, we focus instead on the markers themselves. These are what are called temporal relations. In B-theory there are three major temporal relations:</p>
                
                <ul id="B-relations">
                    <li>Before Than</li>
                    <li>Simultaneous With</li>
                    <li>Later Than</li></ul> 
                These B-relations are important to understand that using relations in place of real temporal flow we can perhaps completely eliminate reference to temporal flow altogether.

             <h3 id="Einstein"><cite>Spacetime and Einstein:</cite></h3>
            In 1905 Albert Einstein revolutionized the world of physics by introducing his Special Relativity Theory (<abbr>SRT</abbr>). Space and time were shown to be linked. The faster one went in distance could slow down the flow of time for that observer if they travelled close to the speed of light. In 1915 Einstein published his General Relativity Theory (<abbr>GRT</abbr>) which showed an even closer relation between space and time by showing that strong gravitational force could actually curve space and slow down the experience of time. It was due to the GRT that allowed for the discovery of black holes where the properties of time become even more strange. However, Einstein was not able to come up with a final theory of physics that tells us everything we want to know about time. This <span style="color: red">final theory</span> is now seen by most physicists as being a quantum theory. This theory hasn't been discovered yet, but it deals with the laws of the universe at a very small scale. The key is understanding how Einstein's GRT is understood from the perspective of this forthcoming quantum gravity theory (<abbr>QGT</abbr>) </blockquote>

                <h2 class="majorpoints">The Best Candidates for Explaining Time</h2>
                <p>Prior to Einstein most physicists and philosophers believed that A-theory of time was the best theory of time. After all, this is how we typically experience time. What could be wrong with such a theory? Things changed with Einstein. GTR is a spatial theory of time and, in fact, people stopped referring to space and time separately and instead began to refer to <small>spacetime</small> with the notion that they aren't separate phenomena but <q>joined at the hip</q> as a way of speaking. Recently, B-theory doesn't experience the dominance it had from the latter half of the Twentieth Century. There were a few recent discoveries that challenged its dominance -- although it probably is still today a very popular theory.</p>

                <h2 class="Conclusion">Conclusion:</h2>
                <p>This has been a very brief introduction to the problem of time. While many of us probably don't think much about this problem, it has been a popular subject among philosophers and scientists since the dawn of these disciplines. I hope that one day a final theory is discovered and that someday we might be able to shed light on which theory is correct, if any. The nature of reality is always a tricky subject and even when we think we have it all figured out a new theory comes along that sheds new light on old problems.</p>
