Our goal is to have our eyes on you from cradle to grave. Next generation traffic cams will fully implement our vision of the future. Our newly developed software agent (Agent Smith) will be able to befriend you and you can ask him any question you want. But, be careful, Agent Smith can get a little grumpy and give you the wrong directions if you're not nice to him.</span></p>
