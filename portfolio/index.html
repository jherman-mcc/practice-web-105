          <p><span>Welcome to my Portfolio page. My company has been in the automotive business for over fifty years, and we are focused on new technology. Our goal is to bring the power of Android App development and our experience with automotive technology together in order to bring 21st Technology to the next generation of electric vehicles. I would like to introduce some of the applications that our company has been working on, and hope that some of what we present has an interest for your company and application.  Where we see the automotive market going over the next ten to fifteen years is a focus on less distracted driving to increase safety. Our focus is about developing apps that meet this criterion. In addition, we hope to help make electric vehicles an easy vehicle to own for the family, so some of our apps are focused in this direction.
